# 7. Use of semantic versioning

Date 7. June 2019

## Status:

proposed

## Context:

To display the current changes and to track different versions of "ghost", a comprehensive versioning mechanism is needed.

## Decision:

"ghost" will use semantic versioning. This means changing the package.json and the gitHub version numbers according to semantic version as described in https://semver.org/ .

## Consequences:

Versioning will represent changes and show user and developers whether changes were made to their current version of "ghost" or not.
