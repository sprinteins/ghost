# 6. Usage of eslint

Date 7. February 2019

## Status:

accepted

## Context:

To make development in "ghost" easier and consistent, a code-convention is needed.

## Decision:

"ghost" will use linting in the airbnb-style.

## Consequences:

Code will be in a unitary format, thus git-differences between commits will be miminized.
